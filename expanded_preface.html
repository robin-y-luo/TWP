    <p> I decided to keep track of my weekly trash items as a method of recording my life and being more mindful of the objects I use and discard. I wanted to see more clearly the accumulation of my trash. Each item has a backstory and reason for landing in my trash can. Most of my trash turned out to be either food waste or packaging. I very rarely throw out full items because of disuse. I tend to hold great sentimental value towards items, and only trash things that are broken beyond repair. Otherwise, my items tend to end up donated, gifted to a friend, or back in my parent’s house.
    </p>
    <p> I share my trash in hopes that other people will follow suit. There is great potential in learning about another person through their discarded items. They keep a unique record of a person’s comings and goings. I also want to invite others to reflect on their consumption patterns. Raised in an Asian household, I was taught to always minimize waste and to recycle/compost properly. I wonder if being more aware of trash will motivate others to practice similar habits. In the future, I hope a pattern will be revealed through my catalog of trash. I hope I am able to learn more about myself, and through this, maybe plan my life accordingly or readjust my habits.
    </p>
    <p> I enjoy <a href="https://anthropology.uchicago.edu/directory/Sarah-Newman">Sarah Newman’s</a> view of connecting archaeology and waste. I have a close friend who told me that the difference between <a href="https://psmag.com/social-justice/hoarding-science-55196/">hoarding</a> and collecting was the value that we see in items. A person with stacks and stacks of magazines from decades ago may seem like a hoarder, but in the eyes of an archivist, they would be doing important work. As Newman says in <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/archaeologist-talks-trash">An archaeologist talks trash</a>, “Archaeologists are the ones who decide whether or not what we find is or is not trash, but we don’t do that in a vacuum—we can’t help but be influenced by the ways the societies that we come from decide what is or is not trash.” Newman also discusses how even when people leave things behind, these things can still be valuable, like an offering. I used to have a bad habit of not being able to let go of material objects, fearing I might miss them or need them some day. This led to a bad hoarding issue. I enjoy her mentality towards considering waste, where it goes, and its life after being “useful”.

    <p> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/06/special-series/vik-muniz-brazil-garbage-art.html">Vik Muniz</a>, in his article <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/06/special-series/vik-muniz-brazil-garbage-art.html">Reframing Trash Into Art</a>, considers trash in the archeological context as well. He thinks about trash as evidence of living, “What we leave behind will mark our brief presence in history. If we care about how these items will reflect upon us, we will consider each purchase we make and each object we produce. Desire is what got us here in the first place; this desire is part of our human nature.” I like this quote as it promotes self-awareness about the things we consume and the lasting impact of the sum total of these items throughout our lifetimes. In his work, Muniz discusses transforming the meaning behind objects. Garbage and ashes become transcendental once he explores the artistic and complex meaning behind them. In my project, although I will not approach the same depth he does in his work, I look towards transforming my ordinary trash by simply placing personal and sentimental value upon them.
    </p>
    <p> Taking a different approach to waste, <a href="https://fallowmedia.com/2016/feb/waste/">Brian Thill</a> discusses his theory on <a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/digital-detritus">digital detritus</a>  in Chapter 2 of his book, Waste. In my own life, I have never considered this waste. In cataloguing my trash, I have revealed more insight into my relationship with discarded items. Things like browser tabs and files make up what could possibly be discarded in a digital sense. Thill explores various forms of waste in addition to digital detritus, including nuclear and pop culture. These forms of discard shape our emotions and our lives. Documenting and keeping track of the history of your waste ultimately allows you to better understand your own consumption patterns and its effect on yourself and the environment around you. This is why I hope others will be inspired by this and similar projects. I hope to see this spark awareness and lead to more sustainable habits, prompting waste to not just be trash, but a meaningful reflection into one’s lifestyle and choices.

    <p> In a 2018 article titled <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/immersive-story/2018/09/20/what-a-waste-an-updated-look-into-the-future-of-solid-waste-management">“What a Waste: An Updated Look into the Future of Solid Waste Management”</a>, the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/ext/en/home">World Bank</a> discusses the significant consequences of waste aggregation in the world. There is a global waste management crisis highlighted in this article, and even a projected increase in trash generation. When I see articles like this that explore the environmental, health, and economic impacts of improper waste disposal, it really makes me consider and become more aware of my daily trash habits. The article talks about the importance of sustainability in taking care of our world, and how we can achieve this with effective waste management.

    <p> In an article titled <a href="https://www.findadump.com/news/landfill-art/?form=MG0AV3">“Landfill Art: How Artists are Turning Trash into Creative Masterpieces”</a>, <a href="https://www.findadump.com/">findadump.com</a>  explores the artistic world of turning waste into art. Artists in this type of work may consider landfills as a gold mine of raw materials to work with, and not simply dirty trash. I was raised to always reuse things before discarding them. I would save shipping boxes to use for storage, and ribbons from presents to tie bouquets. I have boxes and boxes of miscellaneous items on the off chance that I might one day need them. The artists shown in this article do not simply view such items as able to be mundanely repurposed, but as tools with huge purpose that might contribute to a beautiful work of art. They challenge the average person’s perceptions of waste and demonstrate how beauty can be found in treacherous places. There is so much creativity and environmental consciousness in people who make art with discarded materials. I hope to give the items in my project even an ounce of value found in these sculptures.
