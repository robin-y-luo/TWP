			<h2>Preface:</h2>
			<p>
				I decided to keep track of my weekly trash items as a method of recording my life and being more mindful of the objects I use and discard. I wanted to see more clearly the accumulation of my trash. Each item has a backstory and reason for landing in my trash can.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most of my trash turned out to be either food waste or packaging. I very rarely throw out full items because of disuse. I tend to hold great sentimental value towards items, and only trash things that are broken beyond repair. Otherwise, my items tend to end up donated, gifted to a friend, or back in my parent’s house.
			</p>
			<p>
				I share my trash in hopes that other people will follow suit. There is great potential in learning about another person through their discarded items. They keep a unique record of a person’s comings and goings. I also want to invite others to reflect on their consumption patterns. Raised in an Asian household, I was taught to always minimize waste and to recycle/compost properly. I wonder if being more aware of trash will motivate others to practice similar habits.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the future, I hope a pattern will be revealed through my catalog of trash. I hope I am able to learn more about myself, and through this, maybe plan my life accordingly or readjust my habits.

			<h2>Overview:</h2>
	  <p>
				My trash this week told a story of my interactions with loved ones, what happened to me, and activities I chose to do. I had one of the worst illnesses in my entire life, suffering from constant, extreme fatigue and complete lack of appetite. I had a pack of Mucinex cold medicine that my roommate gave to me to help, since I was unable to leave the building independently. The day before this illness hit, I dyed my hair with a cheap box dye that turned it a horrible neon orange. I was suffering from both a cold and ugly hair. The hair dying kit is where the hair mask came from. The bottle of hair dye featured is one of two bottles I had to buy in order to mix together a new color to fix my ruined hair.

			<h3>Group One: Pre-Cold Objects - These are items I was gifted or purchased before I got sick. Many of these represent joyful times and fun activities.
			</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.modelousa.com/pages/story-founders">Beer Bottle</a>: My friend brought a case of these over for a housewarming party. I’ve always loved the shape of these smooth, rounded, glass bottles. I drink these because of an old friend, and they remind me of him each time I get them.</li>
				<li><a href="http://nintendo.com/us/store/products/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOoqtOsAxv-92DrmGT0_BPtRZghvDZn4QYoaW3_b15MjB1rv7Cc9N">Toy Box</a>: My partner bought me this as a gift, because he knows I like Kirby. I kept the box because it has cute designs on it, but I no longer need this cardboard.</li>
				<li><a href="https://idewcare.com/products/scoop-party?variant=46722443084028&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&srsltid=AfmBOopBy5UXAAh9P5kur3nO0dwgkq5gAKyO0Cl49f5B6_2e0EaVYVl3fIw&gQT=1">Face Mask</a>: I bought this for my sister about a year ago because she needed some skin care items. She never used it, so I took it. The mask had strawberry seeds in it.</li>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miffy_and_Friends">Nail Stickers</a>: I bought these at Daiso, the Japanese dollar store. I love Daiso, but it is tragic that they have to increase their prices to almost $2 now.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.lorealparisusa.com/hair-color/hair-color-bleaches/hyper-platinum-advanced-lightening-system-bleach">Hair Mask</a>: This came with the hair dye kit. It barely helps mitigate the ugly orange color.</li>
			</ul>
	  <h3>Group Two: Mid-Cold Objects - These are items I used during my illness. They are utilitarian and sad.</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://vicks.com/en-us/shop-products/dayquil/dayquil-nyquil-liquicaps-cold-medication-co-pack">Cold Medicine</a>: Mucinex given to me by my kind roommate, since I was unable to leave my room. She instructed me to only take half a pill at once, since they are the maximum strength kind. They made me hallucinate and lose sleep. Unsure what they did to alleviate symptoms.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.costco.ca/hero-mighty-patch-original-%2526-invisible%2B%2C-84-count-pack.product.4000281357.html">Acne Patches</a>: I got blisters during the cold, and these helped to heal them.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Group Three: Post-Cold (Recovery) Objects - These are items I bought to celebrate the end of my cold.</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://locations.traderjoes.com/">Flowers</a>: I saw these at a grocery store and I bought them to give to my partner. They were about $5 and they remind me of Spring.</li>
				<li><a href="https://arcticfoxhaircolor.com/products/transylvania-black-hair-dye">Hair Dye</a>: This is the black hair dye variant from Arctic Fox. I mixed it with a purple to create a dark blue color. My hair is now copper with lavender ends. I don’t know how this happened.</li>

			<h2>Item of the Week:</h2>
			<img src="../../../Downloads/iotw_modelo.jpg" width="200"/>
			<p>I selected this item because I have the strongest memory associated with it. I acquired a case of beer for my housewarming party, and I got to see all my friends together for the first time in a while in my new apartment. It was right after a very difficult month where I struggled with loneliness and depression. My friend, on the drive over, picked up the case for us. It was one of the better parties I’ve had in college. Unfortunately, I am currently dealing with small internal conflicts within this same friend group. Despite this, I am certain we will get back to the usual soon. My friend and roommates helped me clean up the area the morning after, which is when the bottle got disposed of.</p>
